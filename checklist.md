## Sprint Challenge: Node-Express
- [ ] Answer questions in Review.md
- [ ] Initialize your project, following the steps in the README to set up your overall project, your server, and your client

### Implement Reqirements
- [ ] Decide how you will tackle the problem and create the necessary files
- [ ] Take the steps necessary to create a package.json to keep a record of all dependencies.
- [ ] Add cors, express, knew and sqlite3.  And add devDependencies - nodemon.
- [ ] Configure an npm script named "start" that will execute your code using nodemon so that the server restarts on changes. Make nodemon be a development time dependency only, it shouldn't be deployed to production.
- [ ] Design and build a set of endpoints that satisfy the API requirements.
- [ ] Perform CRUD operations on Projects and Actions.  **projectModel.js helper includes an extra method called “getProjectActions().**
- [ ] Retrieve the list of actions for a project.
- [ ] Use Postman to test the API as you work through the exercises.

### Stretch Goals
- [ ] Create client side by using create-react-app in separate folder.
- [ ] From the React application show a list of all projects using the API you built.
- [ ] Add functionality to show the details of a project, including its actions, when clicking a project name in the list. Use React Router to navigate to a separate route to show the project details.
- [ ] Add styling! Perhaps with styled-components.
